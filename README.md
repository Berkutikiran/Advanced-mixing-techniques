Audio mixing plays a critical role in the production of high-quality soundtracks for both music and film, ensuring that individual elements combine harmoniously to create an immersive auditory experience. The traditional frequency-based mixing methods focus on isolating each track's frequency content to prevent overlap and distortion. However, this approach often neglects the dynamic range and spatial placement of sound, resulting in a mix that can feel flat or disconnected. In contrast, the proposed multi-level feature-dependent mixing method enhances track integration by considering not only the frequency spectrum but also the dynamic, temporal, and spatial characteristics of each audio element. By analyzing audio at multiple levels, this method allows for more sophisticated adjustments that improve the clarity, and overall cohesiveness of the final mix. It enables automatic adjustments based on real-time analysis of the tracks' evolving features, such as energy levels, frequency content, and placement within the stereo or surround field. This results in a more dynamic, adaptive mixing process, ensuring that each track is seamlessly integrated into the overall production. This approach presents significant advantages over traditional methods, including greater flexibility, adaptability, and precision in handling complex audio mixes. By improving track integration across multiple dimensions, it ensures that all elements blend together naturally, enhancing the depth of the final product. Furthermore, the method's versatility makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, from large-scale commercial productions to independent projects, where seamless track integration is crucial for creating a compelling auditory experience
